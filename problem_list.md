# 5/8
## 1. Dirty Data
* 1.1 no descrip 'flange'/'web'
* 1.2 not suit for batching in order (like plate, can't pass on pullthru , etc.)

## 2. logic Rule
2.1 add the length limited?
2.2 multi orders selecting
2.3 divide the big order(******)

3. programming
3.1 after select order(s), show the order(s)
3.2 when batching, add a icon indicate it is running.
3.3 add export to csv/xls file

## stack list:
- plasma
- flange lines
- prw
- material handle (**)


## flange sort
- stack/sequence
- subpart number
- evection number
- flange:Thickness
        width
        length
- hole location (later)
-- sort by sequence

- sequence defined by length, longest first , shortest last


sequence
- thickness
    - thickest
    - Thinner
    
- length
    - longest
    - shortest
    
## web sort
- ose nesting program
        nesting drawing
        
        alse stack/sequence
        to stay main sequence
-- subparts number
-- thickness / width/ length
-- stack/sequence


## plat line
-- one sort per material size
- thickness * width   combination

detail parts 
    - very difficult to dev by sequence
    - burn by material size
    
batch size : dictated by capacity in PTW
tj - 270m/shift
540/day 
- batch size 1000-1500 m


- subpart no
- L* T * W
- Qty/part
- stack/sequence
-- sort length, --0.3ea

## Burn/Drill
-- Thickness

- subpart no
- L* T * W
- Qty/part
- stack/sequence
- sort length


## stiffener
one report (sort) per thickness
sorted by width
- T * Width list


## clips
-- thickness
supply drawing , decide by man

## workshop need
based total list

# 5/27

- merger batch orders -----ok 2017/06/05
- divide batch order
- manuel choice the type of sub_part
- batch information write to database
- view batch history
- except the parts which not suitable for batch line
- auto analysis the web and flange
- hand weld man-hours

 * The problem of Frame and Purlin direction
 - We have the direction from design and detail like following now:
